## Step 1: Apply Keylight Effect
 
To apply Keylight effect, first import your footage into After Effects and create a new composition. Then, go to Effects & Presets panel and find Keylight under Keying subfolder. Drag and drop the effect onto your footage layer in the timeline.
 
## Step 2: Select Screen Color
 
After applying the effect, you will see a Screen Color setting in the Effect Controls panel. This is where you select the color of the background that you want to remove. To do this, use the Eyedropper tool and click on a representative area of the green screen in your footage. You will see that the green color is replaced by black, indicating that it is transparent.
 
## Step 3: Adjust Keylight Settings
 
Depending on your footage quality and lighting conditions, you may need to adjust some settings in Keylight to get a better result. The most important settings are Screen Gain, Screen Balance, Clip Black and Clip White. These settings control how much of the background color is removed and how much of the foreground color is preserved.
 
- Screen Gain: This setting controls the brightness of the screen color. A higher value means more of the screen color is removed. A lower value means less of the screen color is removed. You can adjust this setting by dragging the slider or typing a value between 0 and 200.
- Screen Balance: This setting controls the balance between red, green and blue components of the screen color. A higher value means more green is removed. A lower value means more red and blue are removed. You can adjust this setting by dragging the slider or typing a value between -100 and 100.
- Clip Black: This setting controls how much of the darker areas of the foreground are removed. A higher value means more of the dark areas are removed. A lower value means less of the dark areas are removed. You can adjust this setting by dragging the slider or typing a value between 0 and 100.
- Clip White: This setting controls how much of the brighter areas of the foreground are removed. A higher value means more of the bright areas are removed. A lower value means less of the bright areas are removed. You can adjust this setting by dragging the slider or typing a value between 0 and 100.

You can also use other settings such as Screen Matte, Screen Pre-Blur, Screen Shrink/Grow, Screen Softness, etc. to fine-tune your keying result. For more details on these settings, you can refer to [this article](https://www.makeuseof.com/getting-started-keylight-plugin-after-effects/).
 
## Step 4: Replace Background
 
Once you are happy with your keying result, you can replace the background with any image or video that you want. To do this, simply import your desired background into After Effects and drag it below your footage layer in the timeline. You can also adjust its position, scale, rotation, opacity, etc. to match your footage.
